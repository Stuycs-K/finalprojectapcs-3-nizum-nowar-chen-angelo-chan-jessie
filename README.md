# Plants vs. Zombies: Cat Edition

## Project Description

This is the classical childhood game, Plants vs Zombies, with a twist: the plants and zombies are all cats!
Zombie cats are invading the town. Add cat plants to your lawn to fend off the zombie cats. However, you can only acquire plants through sun currency. Each plant has its own ability to help you in your fight against the zombies. Zombies kill the plants once they reach them, so try your best to defeat the zombies before they reach the plant. If your plant army fails to stop the zombies from reaching your house, your lawn mowers act as the final line of defense to wipe out the row of zombies.

# Intended usage:

The game starts with an empty lawn and the first wave of zombies waiting on the right side of the lawn. Once the suns start falling from the sky, click on them with your mouse to raise your currency. Your sun bank is displayed on the upper left corner of the screen, showing you your sun currency. Besides the sun bank are three buttons to purchase PeaShooters, SunFlowers, or Snow PeaShooters. The price of each plant is displayed on the button. To purchase a plant, simply click on the button and then click an unoccupied spot on the lawn go place the plant. However, if you have insufficient sun or if there is already a plant there on the lawn, you will not be able to place the plant. On the top right corner is the wave level you are at. If any zombie breaches the house, it is game over. If you defeat all waves of the zombies, you have won the game.

For demonstration purposes, a couple cheat codes have been added to the game.
